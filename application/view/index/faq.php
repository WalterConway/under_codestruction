            <b>Q: How do I make an account?</b><br />
            A: Teachers can register and then make accounts for their students.
            If you're a teacher, go to the <a href="<?php echo Config::get('URL', 'gen') ?>account/register/">registration</a>
            page to get started. Once you've made an account, you will be able to
            create classes and register your students there.

            <b>Q: How can I track my students' progress?</b><br />
            A: As a teacher, once you've made accounts for your students you will
            be able to see their individual progress through each lesson. You
            will be told which lessons they have completed, which lessons they are
            currently progressing through, and how many attempts it took them
            to pass the assessment for each lesson.

            <b>Q: Why is the registration page not accepting my email address?</b><br />
            A: Under Codestruction is designed to be used in public school classrooms,
            so each user must be tied to a .edu email address.
